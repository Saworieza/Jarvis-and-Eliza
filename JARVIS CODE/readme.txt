VOICE ENGINE NOTE:

The standard voice engine used within Jarvis will be the one that is set as default on the users system.
If you type the command 'voice', you can change to Jarvis' voice that we use. This voice is 'Lawrence' by Cepstral, with an effect, and is far superior to Window's offering. The only issue is that of a legal one.
You will need to buy a license from Cepstral to stop the constant nagging, this we apologise for.

We are currently working on another DLA, that of which is more user friendly.
When we are ready to release an alpha version of the new DLA, we shall be releasing the source code for Jarvis, alongside sample codes we personally use to make Jarvis more user specific.


Thank you.
